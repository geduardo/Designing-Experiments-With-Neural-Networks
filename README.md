# Designing-Experiments-With-Neural-Networks
This is the repository for the project of my Master Thesis at ETH ZÃ¼rich.

## Contents

- In `modules/` you can find the `*.py` files that contains the source code
for the different environments, the Experimenter agents, and the Analyzers. 
  **(Ongoing)**
- In `report/` you can find the LaTeX files and the figures of the report, as
well as the PDF of the thesis.   **(Ongoing)**

- In `figures/` you can find all the figures used in this project.

- In the rest of the folders you can find each of the individual experiments 
to test the architecture:
    - **Pendulum**: simplest architecture possible, good to geta feeling the basic 
    functioning principle of the architecture.
    - **Multiarm bandit**: abstract generalization of the pendulum example to an 
    arbitrary number of actions and arbitrary relation.
    - **Spring Bullet**: similar structure than pendulum, but with several
    inputs to the Analyzer.
    - **Two Sensors (Simple)**: a more complex experiment where the experimenter
    needs to develop a dynamical strategy for the experiment.
    - **Two Sensors (Double)**: same environment but with a more sophisticated
    experimenter to improve performance.
    - **Two Sensors (Simple)**: a more complex experiment where the experimenter
    needs to develop a dynamical strategy for the experiment.
    - **Two Sensors (Continuous)**: variation of Two Sensors in which the space
    of actions is continuous. This experiment is a toy example to try different
    parameter based RL agents like Actor-Critic.
